# Using Version control for collaboration {#version_control}

## Overview


## Chapter learning objectives
By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

- Describe what version control is and why data analysis projects can benefit 
from using it
- Create a remote version control repository on GitHub.com
- Move changes to files from GitHub to JupyterHub, and from JupyterHub to GitHub
- Use best practices for collaboration when using version control to collaborate 
on a project with others

## What is version control and why should I use it?

> Below is copied from https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745 and needs to be paraphrased
> "A VCS stores snapshots of a project's files in a repository (or a set of repositories). Programmers can modify their working copy of the project at will, then commit changes to the repository when they are satisfied with the results to share them with colleagues. Crucially, if several people have edited files simultaneously, the VCS highlights the differences and requires them to resolve any conflicts before accepting the changes. The VCS also stores the entire history of those files, allowing arbitrary versions to be retrieved and compared, together with metadata such as comments on what was changed and the author of the changes. All of this information can be extracted to provide provenance for both code and data"

Version control helps solve these challenges in analysis projects, particularly 
those that involve code, by facilitating tracking changes to code and data over 
the lifespan of a project, allowing reversion to earlier versions or states of the 
project and merging changes from collaborators [@wilson2014best]. 

You might find yourself saying, but I am not collaborating, so I don't need to 
use or learn version control. However, as this popular data science quote 
aptly points out, future you often has to collaborate with past you.

*You mostly collaborate with yourself, and me-from-two-months-ago never responds to email*
