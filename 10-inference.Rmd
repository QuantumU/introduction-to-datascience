# Introduction to Sampling and Inference {#inference}

## Overview

Recall from Chapter 1, one of the data analysis questions we often want to answer is inferential question. 

estimation 
confidence intervals 
hypothesis tests 

This chapter provides an introduction to sampling and statistical inference. 

## Chapter learning objectives 
By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

* Explain the sampling distribution of the sample mean.
* Describe the properties of the sampling distribution of the sample mean
* Discuss what a sampling distribution of sample means would look like given different populations, and sample sizes commenting on the shape, center and spread
* Explain why we don't have a sampling distribution in practice/real life.
* Define bootstrapping.
* Recognize the role of sampling distributions in statistical inference.
* Use R to created bootstrap distribution to approximate a sampling distribution.
* Contrast bootstrap and sampling distributions.

## Clustering
Clustering is a data analysis task involving separating a data set into
subgroups of related data. For example, we might use clustering to separate a
dataset of documents into groups that correspond to topics, a dataset of human
genetic information into groups that correspond to ancestral subpopulations, or
a dataset of online customers into groups that correspond to purchasing
behaviours.  Once the data are separated we can, for example, use the subgroups
to generate new questions about the data and follow up with a predictive
modelling exercise. In this course, clustering will be used only for exploratory
analysis, i.e., uncovering patterns in the data that we have.

Note that clustering is a fundamentally different kind of task than
classification or regression. Most notably, both classification and regression
are *supervised tasks* where there is a *predictive target* (a class label or
value), and we have examples of past data with labels/values that help us
predict those of future data. By contrast, clustering is an *unsupervised
task*, as we are trying to understand and examine the structure of data without
any labels to help us. This approach has both advantages and disadvantages.
Clustering requires no additional annotation or input on the data; for example,
it would be nearly impossible to annotate all the articles on Wikipedia with
human-made topic labels, but we can still cluster the articles without this
information to automatically find groupings corresponding to topics. 

However, because there is no predictive target, it is not as easy to evaluate
the "quality" of a clustering.  With classification, we are able to use a test
data set to assess prediction performance. In clustering, there is not a single
good choice for evaluation. In this book, we will use visualization to ascertain
the quality of a clustering, and leave rigorous evaluation for more advanced
courses.

**An illustrative example** 

Suppose we have customer data with two variables measuring
customer loyalty and satisfaction, and we want to learn whether there are distinct "types"
of customer. Understanding this might help us come up with better products or
promotions to improve our business in a data-driven way.

```{r 10-toy-example-data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- tibble(loyalty = c(7, 7.5, 8, 7, 3, 1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 7, 6, 5, 9, 7, 9, 5, 2),
               csat = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 3),
               cluster = c("1",
                           "1",
                           "1",
                           "1",
                           "3",
                           "3",
                           "1",
                           "3",
                           "3",
                           "2",
                           "2",
                           "2",
                           "2",
                           "2",
                           "2",
                           "2",
                           "2",
                           "2", 
                           "3"))
marketing_data <- data[,1:2]
```
```{r 10-clustering}
head(marketing_data)

```{r 10-toy-example-plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Modified from http://www.segmentationstudyguide.com/using-cluster-analysis-for-market-segmentation/"}
base <- ggplot(data, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Customer satisfaction") +
  ylab("Loyalty") +
  xlim(c(0, 10)) +
  ylim(c(0, 10))

base
```

Based on this visualization, we might suspect there are a few subtypes of customer,
selected from combinations of high/low satisfaction and high/low loyalty. How
do we find this grouping automatically, and how do we pick the number of subtypes
to look for? The
way to rigorously separate the data into groups is to use a clustering algorithm.
In this chapter, we will focus on the *K-means* algorithm, a widely-used
and often very effective clustering method, combined with the *elbow method* for
selecting the number of clusters. This procedure will separate the data into 
the following groups denoted by colour:

```{r 10-toy-example-clustering, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(data, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Customer satisfaction") +
  ylab("Loyalty") +
  xlim(c(0, 10)) +
  ylim(c(0, 10))
```

What are the labels for these groups? Unfortunately, we don't have any. K-means,
like almost all clustering algorithms, just outputs meaningless "cluster labels"
that are typically whole numbers: 1, 2, 3, etc. But in a simple case like this,
where we can easily visualize the clusters on a scatter plot, we can give
human-made labels to the groups using their positions on
the plot:

- low loyalty and low satisfaction (<font color="#00BA38">green cluster</font>),
- high loyalty and low satisfaction (<font color="#F8766D">pink cluster</font>), 
- and high loyalty and high satisfaction (<font color="#619CFF">blue cluster</font>).

Once we have made these determinations, we can use them to inform our future business decisions,
or to ask further questions about our data. For example, here we might notice based on our clustering
that there aren't any customers with high satisfaction but low loyalty, and generate new analyses
or business strategies based on this information. 

## K-means 

### Measuring cluster quality

```{r 10-toy-example-clus1, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
clus1 <- tibble(loyalty = c(7, 7.5, 8, 7, 8),
               csat = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3),
               )
#clus1_center <- clus1 %>% summarize(csat = mean(csat), loyalty = mean(loyalty))
```

The K-means algorithm is a procedure that groups data into K clusters.
It starts with an initial clustering of the data, and then iteratively
improves it by making adjustments to the assignment of data
to clusters until it cannot improve any further. But how do we measure
the "quality" of a clustering, and what does it mean to improve it? 
In K-means clustering, we measure the quality of a cluster by its
*within-cluster sum-of-squared-distances* (WSSD). Computing this involves two steps.
First, we find the cluster centers by computing the mean of each variable 
over data points in the cluster. For example, suppose we have a 
cluster containing 3 observations, and we are using two variables, $x$ and $y$, to cluster the data.
Then we would compute the $x$ and $y$ variables, $\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$, of the cluster center via

$$\mu_x = \frac{1}{3}(x_1+x_2+x_3) \quad \mu_y = \frac{1}{3}(y_1+y_2+y_3).$$

In the first cluster from the customer satisfaction/loyalty example, there 
are 5 data points. These are shown with their cluster center 
(`csat = 1.8` and `loyalty = 7.5`) highlighted below.

```{r 10-toy-example-clus1-center, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Cluster 1 from the toy example, with center highlighted."}
base <- ggplot(clus1) +
  geom_point(aes(y = loyalty, x = csat)) +
  labs(x = "Customer satisfaction", y = "Loyalty") +
  xlim(c(0, 4)) +
  ylim(c(6, 9)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean(loyalty), x = mean(csat), colour="red", size=2.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
base
```

The second step in computing the WSSD is to add up the squared distance between each point in the cluster and the cluster center.
We use the straight-line / Euclidean distance formula that we learned about in the classification chapter.
In the 3-observation cluster example above, we would compute the WSSD $S^2$ via

$$S^2 = \left((x_1 - \mu_x)^2 + (y_1 - \mu_y)^2\right) + \left((x_2 - \mu_x)^2 + (y_2 - \mu_y)^2\right) +\left((x_3 - \mu_x)^2 + (y_3 - \mu_y)^2\right).$$

These distances are denoted by lines for the first cluster of the customer satisfaction/loyalty data example below. 

```{r 10-toy-example-clus1-dists, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Cluster 1 from the toy example, with distances to the center highlighted."}
base <- ggplot(clus1) +
  geom_point(aes(y = loyalty, x = csat)) +
  labs(x = "Customer satisfaction", y = "Loyalty") +
  xlim(c(0, 4)) +
  ylim(c(6, 9)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

mn <- clus1 %>% summarize(csat = mean(csat), loyalty=mean(loyalty))
for (i in 1:5) {
  base <- base + geom_segment(x = unlist(mn[1, "csat"]), y = unlist(mn[1, "loyalty"]),
                           xend = unlist(clus1[i, "csat"]), yend = unlist(clus1[i, "loyalty"]))
}
base <- base + geom_point(aes(y = mean(loyalty), x = mean(csat), colour="red", size=2.5)) 
base
```

The larger the value of $S^2$, the more spread-out the cluster is, since large $S^2$ means that points are far away from the cluster center.
Note, however, that "large" is relative to *both* the scale of the variables for clustering *and* the number of points in the cluster; a 
cluster where points are very close to the center might still have a large $S^2$ if there are many data points in the cluster. 

### The clustering algorithm

The K-means algorithm is quite simple. We begin by picking K, and uniformly randomly assigning data to the K clusters. 
Then K-means consists of two major steps that attempt to minimize the
sum of WSSDs over all the clusters, i.e. the *total WSSD*:

1. **Center update:** Compute the center of each cluster.
2. **Label update:** Reassign each data point to the cluster with the nearest center.

These two steps are repeated until the cluster assignments no longer change.
For example, in the customer data example from earlier, our initialization might look like this:
<center>
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-init, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Random initialization of labels."}
library(gridExtra)
set.seed(2)
marketing_data["label"] = factor(sample(1:3, nrow(marketing_data), replace=T))

plt_lbl <- ggplot(marketing_data, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, colour=label)) +
    geom_point(size=2) +
    xlab("Customer satisfaction") +
    ylab("Loyalty") +
    xlim(c(0, 10)) +
    ylim(c(0, 10)) + 
    theme(legend.position = "none")
print(plt_lbl)
```
</center>

And the first three iterations of K-means would look like (each row corresponds to an iteration,
where the left column depicts the center update, 
and the right column depicts the reassignment of data to clusters): 
<center>
**Center Update**  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;**Label Update**
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-iter, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
for (i in 1:3){
    #compute centers
    centers <- marketing_data %>% group_by(label) %>% summarize_all(funs(mean))
    nclus = nrow(centers)
    #replot with centers
    plt_ctr <- ggplot(marketing_data, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, colour=label)) +
        geom_point(size=2) +
        xlab("Customer satisfaction") +
        ylab("Loyalty") +
        xlim(c(0, 10)) +
        ylim(c(0, 10)) + 
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        geom_point(data = centers, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, fill = label), size=5, shape = 21, stroke = 2, colour = "black") 
    
    #reassign labels
    dists <- rbind(centers, marketing_data) %>% 
           select("csat", "loyalty") %>%
           dist() %>%
           as.matrix()
    dists <- as_tibble(dists[-(1:nclus),1:nclus])
    marketing_data <- marketing_data %>% mutate(label = apply(dists, 1, function(x) names(x)[which.min(x)]))
    
    plt_lbl <- ggplot(marketing_data, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, colour=label)) +
        geom_point(size = 2) +
        xlab("Customer satisfaction") +
        ylab("Loyalty") +
        xlim(c(0, 10)) +
        ylim(c(0, 10)) + 
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        geom_point(data = centers, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, fill = label), size=5, shape = 21, stroke = 2, colour = "black") 
    
    #to generate the animated version, get rid of grid.arrange and use the below two lines
    #set the figure width to 4.35 too
    #print(plt_ctr)
    #print(plt_lbl)
    grid.arrange(plt_ctr, plt_lbl, nrow = 1)
}
```
</center>

Note that at this point we can terminate the algorithm, since none of the assignments changed
in the third iteration; both the centers and labels will remain the same from this point onward.

### Random restarts

K-means, unlike the classification and regression models we studied in previous chapters, can get "stuck" in a bad solution.
For example, if we were unlucky and initialized K-means with the following labels:
<center>
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-bad-init, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Random initialization of labels."}
set.seed(7)
marketing_data["label"] = factor(sample(1:3, nrow(marketing_data), replace=T))

plt_lbl <- ggplot(marketing_data, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, colour=label)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    xlab("Customer satisfaction") +
    ylab("Loyalty") +
    xlim(c(0, 10)) +
    ylim(c(0, 10)) + 
    theme(legend.position = "none")
print(plt_lbl)
```
</center>

Then the iterations of K-means would look like:
<center>
**Center Update**  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;**Label Update**
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-bad-iter, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
for (i in 1:5){
    #compute centers
    centers <- marketing_data %>% group_by(label) %>% summarize_all(funs(mean))
    nclus = nrow(centers)
    #replot with centers
    plt_ctr <- ggplot(marketing_data, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, colour=label)) +
        geom_point(size = 2) +
        xlab("Customer satisfaction") +
        ylab("Loyalty") +
        xlim(c(0, 10)) +
        ylim(c(0, 10)) + 
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        geom_point(data = centers, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, fill = label), size=5, shape = 21, stroke = 2, colour = "black") 
    
    #reassign labels
    dists <- rbind(centers, marketing_data) %>% 
           select("csat", "loyalty") %>%
           dist() %>%
           as.matrix()
    dists <- as_tibble(dists[-(1:nclus),1:nclus])
    marketing_data <- marketing_data %>% mutate(label = apply(dists, 1, function(x) names(x)[which.min(x)]))
    
    plt_lbl <- ggplot(marketing_data, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, colour=label)) +
        geom_point(size = 2) +
        xlab("Customer satisfaction") +
        ylab("Loyalty") +
        xlim(c(0, 10)) +
        ylim(c(0, 10)) + 
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        geom_point(data = centers, aes(y = loyalty, x = csat, fill = label), size=5, shape = 21, stroke = 2, colour = "black") 
    
    #print(plt_ctr)
    #print(plt_lbl)
    grid.arrange(plt_ctr, plt_lbl, nrow = 1)
}
```
</center>

This looks like a relatively bad clustering of the data, but K-means cannot improve it.
To solve this problem when clustering data using K-means, we should randomly re-initialize the labels a few times, run K-means for each initialization,
and pick the clustering that has the lowest final total WSSD.

### Choosing K

In order to cluster data using K-means, we also have to pick the number of clusters, K.
But unlike in classification, we have no data labels and cannot perform
cross-validation with some measure of model prediction error.
Further, if K is chosen too small, then multiple clusters get grouped together;
if K is too large, then clusters get subdivided. In both cases, we will potentially miss
interesting structure in the data. For example, take a look below at the K-means
clustering of our customer satisfaction and loyalty data for a number of clusters
ranging from 1 to 9.

```{r 10-toy-kmeans-vary-k, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 12, fig.cap = "Clustering of the customer data for # clusters ranging from 1 to 9."}
library(broom)
set.seed(3)
kclusts <- tibble(k = 1:9) %>%
  mutate(
    kclust = map(k, ~kmeans(marketing_data[-3], .x)),
    tidied = map(kclust, tidy),
    glanced = map(kclust, glance),
    augmented = map(kclust, augment, marketing_data[-3])
  )

clusters <- kclusts %>%
  unnest(tidied)

assignments <- kclusts %>% 
  unnest(augmented)

clusterings <- kclusts %>%
  unnest(glanced, .drop = TRUE)

assignments$k <- factor(assignments$k)
levels(assignments$k) <- c("1 Cluster", "2 Clusters", "3 Clusters", "4 Clusters", "5 Clusters", "6 Clusters", "7 Clusters", "8 Clusters", "9 Clusters") 

clusters$k <- factor(clusters$k)
levels(clusters$k) <- c("1 Cluster", "2 Clusters", "3 Clusters", "4 Clusters", "5 Clusters", "6 Clusters", "7 Clusters", "8 Clusters", "9 Clusters") 


p1 <- ggplot(assignments, aes(csat, loyalty)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = .cluster, size = 3)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ k) +
  labs(x = 'Customer satisfaction', y = 'Loyalty', colour = 'Cluster') +
  theme(text = element_text(size=20), legend.position = "none") +
  geom_point(data = clusters %>% mutate(csat = x2, loyalty = x1), aes(fill = cluster), colour = "black", size = 5, shape = 21, stroke = 2)

p1
```

If we set K less than 3, then the clustering merges separate groups of data; this causes a large causing a large
total WSSD, since the cluster center (denoted by an "x") is not close to any of the data in the cluster. On 
the other hand, if we set K greater than 3, the clustering subdivides subgroups of data; this does indeed still 
decrease the total WSSD, but by only a *diminishing amount*. If we plot the total WSSD versus the number of 
clusters, we see that the decrease in total WSSD levels off (or forms an "elbow shape") when we reach roughly 
the right number of clusters.
<center>
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-elbow, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10, fig.cap = "Total WSSD for # clusters ranging from 1 to 9."}
p2 <- ggplot(clusterings, aes(x = k, y = tot.withinss)) +
        geom_point(size = 2) +
        geom_line() +
        annotate("text", x = 3.5, y = 50, label="Elbow", size=10, colour = "blue") +
        labs(x = "# Clusters", y = "Total WSSD") +
        theme(text = element_text(size=20)) + 
        scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9)
p2
```
</center>

## K-means in R

To peform K-means clustering in R, we use the `kmeans` function. It takes at
least two arguments, the data frame containing the data you wish to cluster,
and K, the number of clusters (here we choose K = 3). Note that since the K-means
algorithm uses a random initialization of assignments, we need to set the random
seed to make the clustering reproducible.

```{r 10-kmeans}
set.seed(1234)
marketing_clust <- kmeans(marketing_data, centers = 3)
marketing_clust
```

As you can see above, the clustering object returned has a lot of information
about our analysis that we need to explore. Let's take a look at it now. To do
this, we will call in help from the `broom` package so that we get the model
output back in a tidy data format. Let's first start by getting the cluster
identification for each point and plotting that on the scatter plot. To do that
we use the augment function. Augment takes in the model and the original data
frame, and returns a data frame with the data and the cluster assignments for
each point:

```{r 10-plot-clusters-1}

clustered_data <- augment(marketing_clust, marketing_data)
head(clustered_data)
```

Now that we have this data frame, we can easily plot the data (i.e., cluster assignments of each point):

```{r 10-plot-clusters-2, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35}

cluster_plot <- ggplot(clustered_data, aes(x = csat, y = loyalty, colour = .cluster), size=2) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = 'Customer satisfaction', y = 'Loyalty', colour = 'Cluster')
cluster_plot
```

As mentioned above, we need to choose a K to perform K-means clustering by finding
where the "elbow" occurs in the plot of total WSSD versus number of clusters. 
We can get at the total WSSD (`tot.withinss`) from our
clustering using `broom`'s `glance` function (it gives model-level statistics).
For example:

```{r 10-glance}
glance(marketing_clust)
```

To calculate the total WSSD for a variety of Ks, we will
create a data frame with a column named `k` with rows containing the numbers of clusters
we want to run K-means with (here, 1 to 9). Then we use `map` to apply the `kmeans` function to each
K. We also use `map` to then apply `glance` to each of the clusterings.
This results in a complex data frame with
3 columns, one for K, one for the models, and one for the model statistics
(output of `glance`, which is a data frame):

```{r 10-choose-k, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35}
marketing_clust_ks <- tibble(k = 1:9) %>%
  mutate(marketing_clusts = map(k, ~kmeans(marketing_data, .x)),
         glanced = map(marketing_clusts, glance)) 
head(marketing_clust_ks)
```

We now extract the total WSSD from the `glanced` column. Given that each item in
this column is a data frame, we will need to use the `unnest` function to
unpack the data frames. 

```{r 10-get-total-within-sumsqs}
clustering_statistics <- marketing_clust_ks %>%
  unnest(glanced)

head(clustering_statistics)
```

Now that we have `tot.withinss` and `k` as columns in a data frame, we can make a line plot 
and search for the "elbow" to find which value of K to use. 


```{r 10-plot-choose-k, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35}
elbow_plot <- ggplot(clustering_statistics, aes(x = k, y = tot.withinss)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("K") +
  ylab("Total within-cluster sum of squares")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9)
elbow_plot
```

It looks like 3 clusters is the right choice for this data.
But why is there a "bump" in the total WSSD plot here? Shouldn't total WSSD always
decrease as we add more clusters? Technically yes, but remember:  K-means can 
get "stuck" in a bad solution. Unfortunately, for K = 6 we had an unlucky initialization
and found a bad clustering! We can help prevent finding a bad clustering by trying a 
few different random initializations via the `nstart` argument (here we use 10 restarts). 
```{r 10-choose-k-nstart, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35}
marketing_clust_ks <- tibble(k = 1:9) %>%
  mutate(marketing_clusts = map(k, ~kmeans(marketing_data, nstart = 10, .x)),
         glanced = map(marketing_clusts, glance)) 

clustering_statistics <- marketing_clust_ks %>%
  unnest(glanced)

elbow_plot <- ggplot(clustering_statistics, aes(x = k, y = tot.withinss)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("K") +
  ylab("Total within-cluster sum of squares")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9)
elbow_plot
```
