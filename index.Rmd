# Preface {-}

This is an open source textbook aimed at introducing undergraduate students to data science. It was originally written for the University of British Columbia's [DSCI 100 - Introduction to Data Science](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/dsci-100/) course. In this book, we define data science as the study and development of reproducible, auditable processes to obtain value (i.e., insight) from data. 

## Why read this book {-}

This book will provide readers unfamiliar with data science an introduction to
the field, advice on best practices for performing data analysis, as well as 
practical skills to get up and going doing their own data analyses.

## Structure of the book {-}

The book is structured so that learners spend the first four chapters learning how to use the R programming language and Jupyter notebooks to load, wrangle/clean, and visualize data, while answering descriptive and exploratory data analysis questions. The remaining chapters illustrate how to solve four common problems in data science, which are useful for answering predictive and inferential data analysis questions.

## Software information and conventions {-}

I used the **knitr**\index{knitr} package [@xie2015] and the **bookdown**\index{bookdown} package [@R-bookdown] to compile my book. My R session information is shown below:

```{r}
xfun::session_info()
```

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).

## Acknowledgments {-}

A lot of people helped me when I was writing the book.
